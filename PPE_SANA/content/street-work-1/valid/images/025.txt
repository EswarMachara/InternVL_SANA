Several workers in blue uniforms and white safety helmets are actively engaged in inspecting and operating large blue industrial machines. One worker is handling and adjusting a mechanical component on a machine, while others observe or assist. Most workers are using their right hands for tasks, likely to avoid blocking their vision. The environment suggests an industrial setting focused on machinery maintenance or operation, with tools and equipment visible around the workers. No specific PPE like goggles or masks are clearly visible, and proper attention to safety is evident through the consistent use of helmets.
