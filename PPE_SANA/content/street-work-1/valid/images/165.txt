Two workers are engaged in a conversation on a factory floor, wearing matching grey uniforms with blue and red strips and white helmets with clear face shields. The worker on the left is holding a phone to his ear, seemingly discussing something, while the worker on the right is gesturing with his hands, possibly explaining a task or providing instructions. Both workers are wearing black boots and black gloves, ensuring their safety.

The environment is an industrial setting, with a white building in the background and a motorcycle parked by the door. The workers are standing on a concrete floor, which seems to be a clean and organized workspace. No visible sparks or hazardous materials
