In the factory scene, a worker is engaged in metalwork, working on an assembly line. They are using a power tool to shape or cut metal, likely stainless steel based on the materials evident. The worker is wearing a helmet for head protection, gloves, and an eye shield. A safety vest is also visible, but the mask appears to be missing, which is a critical point concerning complete PPE usage. The environment around the worker includes open spaces in certain areas and concrete or tiled walkways for safe navigation. The emphasis is on ensuring PPE availability for safety, with a particular attention to the missing mask.
