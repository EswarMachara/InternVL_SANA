A worker is assembling a vehicle in an outdoor factory setting. They are using a manual tool to work on the car's cabin, wearing a safety helmet and a protective work vest. The worker is standing on a construction floor, surrounded by cones and a crowd of people in uniform on an elevated platform. Safety cones are scattered around the area, and some individuals around the car are wearing helmets and safety vests, though one person might be missing or improperly wearing PPE. The environment appears to be a makeshift workshop with a dirt surface.
