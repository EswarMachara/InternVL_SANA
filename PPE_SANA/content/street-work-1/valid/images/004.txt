In the given factory scene, a group of workers is gathered around a fountain in a landscaped outdoor area adjacent to urban high-rise buildings. The workers appear to be engaged in a discussion or inspection, as several individuals are holding papers or pamphlets. 

Among the workers, basic safety practices are observed, although none are highlighted. They are dressed in formal attire, including button-down shirts and slacks. 

There is no specific evidence of wearing PPE such as helmets, gloves, goggles, masks, or safety vests in the image. The focus is mainly on their interaction rather than the use of machinery or protective equipment
