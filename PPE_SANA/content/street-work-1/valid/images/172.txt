A worker is dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE) for a laboratory or high-containment task environment. They are wearing a white hazmat suit, a blue head covering, and a yellow protective mask. The worker has not yet taken off the hood. There are bags labeled "JUNGE" and a blue container visible in the background, suggesting the possibility of hazardous materials handling or storage. The environment is clean and industrial, likely a controlled setting for handling potentially dangerous substances. The worker should remove the hood as per the instruction "Take off hood" to ensure a full coverage of PPE and proper safety protocols.
