A worker is engaged in maintenance on a piece of equipment from inside a yellow高空 lift with the text "高空作业" (general term for height work) on the side. The worker is wearing a red helmet, high-visibility safety vest, gloves, and jeans. The PPE appears to be appropriate for the task, though no mask is visible. The setting appears to be a construction or industrial environment, involving construction work and machinery handling.
