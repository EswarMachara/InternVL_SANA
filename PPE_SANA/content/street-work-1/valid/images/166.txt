A worker, wearing a white helmet, face shield, light gray work clothes with blue and red accents, and black boots, is operating a handheld device or smartphone while standing on a concrete floor outside a building. The worker has reflective orange stripes on the pants and appears focused on their task. In the background, another worker is bent over, holding or interacting with a tool or piece of equipment on the ground. The environment is industrial, with a white building and windows, as well as a parked motorcycle nearby.

The workplace seems to be an outdoor area with minimal tools and equipment visible on the ground, such as a toolbox and bags. Safety
