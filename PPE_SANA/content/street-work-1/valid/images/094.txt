In a snowy mountainous area, a worker is seen navigating a winding road dotted with orange traffic cones. The worker is using a machine, potentially for clearing snow or guiding vehicles. The worker is wearing a green safety vest and orange hard hat, indicating adherence to basic safety protocols. No other PPE such as gloves or goggles is clearly visible in this frame, suggesting the focus might be more on identification and basic safety gear. The environment is cold and rugged, typical of a winter road maintenance site, with mountains in the background covered in snow, enhancing the need for safety measures at this location.
