In the image, a worker is standing on a salt flat, surrounded by a red traffic cone. The workspace appears open and expansive, with a clear sky overhead and distant mountain ranges on the horizon. The worker is wearing simple PPE, including a safety vest and a helmet. There are no visible gloves or goggles on the worker. The environment looks quite open and dry, with no machinery or tools in immediate use, suggesting this area may be for safety markings or as a landmark on the site.
