In the image, two construction workers stand in front of an ongoing construction site. They are wearing safety helmets—one in blue and the other in brown—and brown jackets, indicating their roles on the construction site. Each worker is holding a calculator or phone, likely checking plans or communicating with colleagues.

The construction site features exposed steel frameworks with orange safety nets, and a large crane is visible in the background, indicating heavy ongoing work. The environment appears dynamic and active, typical of a construction site where measurements and communication are vital for safety and efficiency.

While the workers are mostly equipped with safety gear, the image does not show the worker's PPE
