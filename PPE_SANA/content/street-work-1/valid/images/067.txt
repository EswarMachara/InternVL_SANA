A worker is engaged in maintenance or cleaning activities on a swimming pool deck. The worker is interacting with the pool, possibly using tools to remove debris or maintain the water quality, as evidenced by the trash bin nearby and a cleaning rope in the water. The worker is not wearing any PPE such as a helmet, gloves, goggles, mask, or safety vest, which suggests a lack of proper protective gear fitting the hazard of the environment. The surroundings include tiled flooring around the pool, indicating a clean workplace but lacking robust safety protocols regarding personal protective equipment.
