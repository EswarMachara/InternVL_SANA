During a construction site inspection, several traffic cones are arranged on the brick-paved ground in front of a brick wall. The cones are wrapped in red and white caution tape, indicating an area under construction or restricted access. The scene shows one worker actively standing on the brick floor, surrounded by debris, suggesting ongoing or recent work. The worker is wearing standard safety gear including safety gloves and a safety vest, but no visible safety helmet is being worn. The environment indicates a construction floor area, with the cones marking the periphery of work zones. The safety context highlights adherence to caution and construction site regulations.
