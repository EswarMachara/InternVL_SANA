A worker in full protective gear stands with hands giving thumbs up. Wearing a white hazmat suit, mask, goggles, and gloves, the worker is positioned in front of a plain white background. To the left is a black chair, and to the right is a light blue table with a bottle of hand sanitizer, paper towel, and pen on it.

**Note**: The image does not show a machine or tools in use, indicating the worker may not be involved in a specific task that requires these, such as assembly line work or welding. The emphasis is on strict PPE usage, including comprehensive protective clothing and eye protection.
