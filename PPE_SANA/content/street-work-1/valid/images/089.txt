In the image, a worker is walking among a series of orange traffic cones on a gravel surface, seemingly engaged in a task that may involve navigating a construction site or hazardous area. The worker is dressed in dark blue pants and a light gray t-shirt and is wearing sneakers. There is no visible PPE such as a helmet, gloves, goggles, mask, or safety vest on the worker in the image.

The setting suggests a construction or outdoor work environment with mountains in the background. The traffic cones are prominently placed, possibly indicating a restricted or safety zone on the construction floor.
