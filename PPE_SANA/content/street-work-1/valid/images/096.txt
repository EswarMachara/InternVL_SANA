A worker is actively engaged in maneuvering through a series of bright orange traffic cones placed on a flat concrete surface, likely part of a safety setup or training exercise. The worker is wearing appropriate safety gear, including a safety vest and helmet, ensuring adherence to safety protocols. The absence of gloves or goggles is noted, and the overall environment seems to be a controlled, open area, possibly an assembly or training floor, emphasizing safety with marked pathways and clear visibility.
