In the foreground, an orange traffic cone mounted on a black base is secured with a chain to section off a grassy area. The setting appears to be a training or demonstration area, likely used for safety training or organizational purposes. One cone chain-free, possibly indicating it is part of a training exercise where safety equipment is being demonstrated or inspected.

While no workers or specific tasks are visible, the presence of safety equipment (chain on cones) highlights an emphasis on attention
