In the dark night, a worker wearing a yellow helmet, safety vest, and gloves is engaged in maintenance work on a utility pole. He is holding a tool, possibly for inspecting or fixing the cables and equipment attached to the pole. The worker is standing on a sturdy platform constructed around the pole, ensuring stability for his task. Despite his focus, there is no visible presence of goggles or a mask, which could be important for additional safety measures. The surrounding area appears to be a construction or industrial site, with buildings faintly illuminated in the background, highlighting the worker's solitary effort amidst the darkness.
