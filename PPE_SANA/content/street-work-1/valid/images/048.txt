A worker is directing another worker at a power substation located adjacent to a tall electrical tower adorned with numerous wires and insulators. The worker wears a blue hard hat, a red and white safety vest, and reflective stripes, with the words "National Grid" and "STATE GRID" emblazoned on the back. His right arm is raised, possibly signaling or directing the task at hand. The work environment appears to be an outdoor construction or maintenance area involving industrial electrical equipment. The presence of other individuals also suggests that this is a collaborative task at a safe industrial site.
