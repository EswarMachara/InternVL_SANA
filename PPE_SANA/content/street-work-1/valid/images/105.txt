In the factory scene, a worker is wearing a protective yellow garment and a blue surgical mask. They are in the process of adjusting the mask with their right hand, ensuring it fits properly over their nose and mouth. The worker is not wearing gloves and no helmet or goggles are visible in the image, which might indicate a lack of full PPE in use at this moment. The background is black, suggesting a controlled environment, possibly an assembly line area where personal protective equipment is critical for safety.
