A worker in a factory is adjusting wires, wearing a light-colored helmet, safety vest, and gloves, standing beside an open van that displays various tools and machinery. Several orange traffic cones are scattered around, likely indicating caution or a restricted area. The environment appears to be a construction or utility workspace with some concrete pathways. The worker is handling essential wiring tasks, ensuring all necessary personal protective equipment are in place for a safe working environment.
