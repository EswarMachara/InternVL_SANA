In the factory scene, a worker appears to be managing a piece of safety equipment along with a set of machinery tools. The worker is engaged in tasks that involve handling a black wire connected to orange and white traffic cones, which are sitting loosely on a rough asphalt floor. The worker is wearing standard PPE, but there seems to be an absence of a mask or additional eye protection.

The machinery or tools in use include a safety cone, a hard hat, and an electrical plug with a disconnected cord. The setting indicates a focus on maintenance or cleanup of the equipment, as evidenced by the presence of debris and equipment scattered on the work surface
