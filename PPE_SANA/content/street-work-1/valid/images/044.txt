Electricians are working on a power utility pole, handling high-voltage electrical cables and components. All six workers are wearing blue safety vests, blue hard hats, and are secured with safety harnesses. Yellow lanyards are attached to their harnesses to ensure secure belaying, minimizing the risk of falls. The environment looks like a night-time or indoor setup, and the workers are carefully navigating around insulators and other electrical equipment. Proper PPE usage appears to be emphasized in this task, focusing on safety measures against electrical hazards.
