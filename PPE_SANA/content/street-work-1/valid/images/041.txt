In a construction floor, four workers are attending to rebar work within a scaffold structure. All workers are wearing safety helmets with one worker in yellow and three in red. The red helmet worker is standing closer to the mesh grid of the rebar which is laid out on the ground. The workers appear to be involved in tying or placing the rebar. The environment includes extensive scaffolding and construction materials, emphasizing the ongoing nature of the construction project. Each worker seems attentively performing their tasks, ensuring necessary safety equipment is in place.
