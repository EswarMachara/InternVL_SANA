A worker is preparing to put on a blue protective gown in what appears to be a healthcare or manufacturing setting. The worker has on disposable gloves and is holding the gown, positioning it to cover the shoulders. There is a sign posted on the door behind the worker, indicating some form of instruction or policy, possibly related to safety or personal protective equipment (PPE). The environment suggests a focus on maintaining cleanliness and safety, likely in an area where sterile or protective environments are necessary.
