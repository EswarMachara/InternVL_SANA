A worker in a blue gown and mask is seen disinfecting a surface with an alcohol wipe, likely in preparation for a high-risk task or as a measure of hygiene. The specific PPE being worn includes a gown and a mask, and the worker appears to have a blue disposable glove on their hand. The room has a door in the background with a hand sanitizer dispenser, and a mirror and a small wooden table with folded white towels are visible. The environment looks clean and controlled, possibly part of a healthcare or manufacturing setting where cleanliness is critical.
